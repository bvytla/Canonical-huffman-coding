# Canonical-huffman-coding
This project explores the implementation of Canonical Huffman Coding for compressing 64-bit 
data blocks, aiming to provide an efficient, lossless data compression method essential for 
digital storage and high-speed data transmission. As data demands grow across digital 
systems, the need to optimize storage while ensuring data integrity is increasingly important. 
Canonical Huffman Coding, an enhancement of traditional Huffman Coding, encodes symbols 
based on frequency, with more frequent symbols requiring fewer bits. In this study, the 
algorithm is implemented using Verilog HDL and tested on an FPGA platform, allowing a 
detailed evaluation of compression ratio, power consumption, area utilization, and processing 
delay. The implementation in Verilog HDL enables the design to be synthesized on hardware 
for real-world testing, with results indicating that Canonical Huffman Coding achieves 
significant data size reduction with minimal trade-offs in speed and hardware efficiency. This 
approach offers a promising solution for applications requiring high throughput and minimal 
resource utilization, such as embedded systems, real-time data processing, and FPGA-based 
digital communication networks
